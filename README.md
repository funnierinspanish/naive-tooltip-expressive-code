# Naive Code Tooltip for Expressive Code

Not much to say, still a work in progress.

Goal: To provide a simple and expressive way to create tooltips for code snippets in markdown files without having to be limited to what [Twoslash](https://github.com/twoslashes/twoslash) can provide (JS/TS/and variations).
